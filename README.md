# React based Spotify clone

The project aimed at creating a user interface for the user to independantly stream music with the help of Spotify Web API and Spotify Web Playback SDK.

The website took use of React to render the data fetched from Spotify API via axios requests and play the requested track via Spotify's Web playback SDK package.

User can see his Spotify account data and play requested tracks via the music player.
(User can only use the website if he/she has Spotify premium since web playback SDK only works for premium users.)


## Features

- User can see his spotify account saved playlist and tracks.
- Can stream songs independently.
- Can use searchbar to search for songs in spotify database.
- Can switch between the web app to spotify's official app or website seamlessly.
